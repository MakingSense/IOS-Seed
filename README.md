# iOS-Seed

## MVVM seed for native iOS development in Swift

This project contains the codebase for an MVVM iOS application in Swift. It relies on Bond library to support databinding, and IoC with Dip. Also it implements a view-first navigation among other important features such as continuous integration with BuddyBuild.

The structure of the project is as follow:

- Interfaces Layer
  - iOS UI (Storyboards, Views/ViewControllers, and other UI components)

- Application Layer
  - ViewModels, CompositionRoot for Dip framework, and non platform-specific components
  
- Domain Layer
  - Services and models

- Infraestructure Layer
  - Network, Persistence, Extensions and Utils classes
 
- Pods project
  - Autogenerated project via CocoaPods for external libraries integration
